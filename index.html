  <h2>Longer more interesting transcript</h2>
  <p>One thought leader and entrepreneur who inspired me is Mike Bostock.</p>
  <p>The name will probably not ring a bell unless you work in data visualization, but he is well-known in that domain.</p>
  <p>He created the influential open-source data visualization library for the web known as <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3</a>, or data driven documents.</p>
  <p>He also created <a href="https://observablehq.com/" target="_blank">Observable</a>, a data visualization platform for sharing data insights collaboratively via notebooks.</p>
  <p>More than a decade ago in 2013, a younger me was inspired by his brilliant work he did at the New York Times then, and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html" target="_blank">his work</a> sent me down a rabbit hole wondering how the hell I could do something just as beautiful.</p>
  <p>At that time I was working in public relations at PR agency GolinHarris, but I was bored and unfufilled. As an ex-journalist and storyteller, the data visualizations <b>spoke</b> to me.</p>
  <br/>
  <hr/>
  
  <p>So I quit and started my own small data visualization studio <a href="https://www.vslashr.com/" target="_blank">VslashR</a>, which I would not suggest to anyone who needs to pay bills.</p>
  <p>I really had little idea of what I was doing then, but somehow survived as a small business, which I attribute to more luck than grit.</p>
  <p>Looking back it has been a really fufilling decade-plus of learning how to code again, meeting <a href="https://decks.vslashr.com/creds/#/" target="_blank">great clients</a> and friends, running data visualization <a href="https://www.meetup.com/data-vis-singapore/" target="_blank">meetup events</a> (still ongoing), and in the last five years I've <a href="https://chi-loong.github.io/IDV/" target="_blank">taught data viz</a> at universities as well.</p>
  <p>As an engineer, I have deep respect for thought leaders who put in the work and time to build great products. People who are not just ego-driven attention seekers that only worship at the altar of money.</p>
  <p>Better still if the work is shared freely and open-source, multiplying the impact and benefit. So thank you Mike Bostock.</p>
  <br/>

  <p>In tech, like in many other domains, we stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
  <p>Without Linus Torvalds we wouldn't have Linux or Git. No Bitcoin or Blockchain without Satoshi. Even in the capitalist world there would be no Apple without Steve Wozniak.</p>
  <p>As I grow older I appreciate community and the interconnectedness of our world more.</p>
  <p>As the oft-quoted aphorism goes: "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."</p>
  <p>I hope to find interesting people who might think like this in my one year Masters journey here. Thank you.</p>
